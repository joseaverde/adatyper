Bugs Reporting
==============
The game doesn't have any tool to report bugs yet, neither a form template so if
you happen to find a bug or a typo (English is not my native language, sorry)
please, report it at <https://github.com/joseaverde/adatyper/issues> or sent me a
mail if you want at <joseaverde@pm.me>. In the future if this game is popular (I
think it won't, but I don't lose anything dreaming) this will be changed.

## Contributing to the code or fixing bugs
As this is my first big project I think will survive, I would like to be the one
in fixing the bugs. I just want to learn and improve my abilities in Ada.

## Bug report example:
```text
Title:
Version:
OS(Distribution):
GNAT/Compiler Version:
Raised Exception:
(If possible) Replication:
(More information if you think is relevant)
```

For example:
```text
Title: Game crashes when entering Credits
Version: 0.2.4
OS: Linux/Debian
GNAT Version: 9.1
Raised Exception: Constraint_Error
Replication: When I enter the Credits.
Game Language: Spanish
```

It's not going to be parsed by a program yet, I'm going to read it, so the
format isn't that important.
